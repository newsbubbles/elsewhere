This page was created to list any papers/github/notebook resources we have found online and have studied or are actively studying. Categories are listed, and sub-folders of this will hold individual research paths through some of the resources listed here.

In order to "build the metaverse" we need to focus on some key areas in research and development:
* 2D image vs. 3D mesh diffusion models
** Extracting 3D from 2D
** 3D Voxel Diffusion Models
* Automatic Generative 3D Prompt Engineering (regardless of 2D and 3D)
* Audio/Music Diffusion Models
* Fast General Physics Simulation
* Non Player Character Intelligence
* Scalable P2P Gaming Network Architecture
* Procedural World Generation
* AI Generated Storytelling
** Global AI Controllers
* Human Interfaces
** VR / AR
** Speech to Text to Prompt
** Brain to Computer
** Computer to Brain
* Optimization Methods

Linking to a resource, the format to follow is:
