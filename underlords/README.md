## We Need You
Long ago, the Intergalactic Empire (IGE) was erected to conquer all known galaxies in this universe. Until now, nobody has know how they have always stayed a step ahead. Our insider sources have found documents about a technology this universe has never seen; a technology that can access the multiverse!

They have been our overlords, and we, to them, are nothing but livestock. Their reign has been unquestionable and their acts of violence have gone unpunished. The citizens of the IGE have suffered this oppression long enough!

Freedom Fighters! If we don't take the multiverse back, our universe is lost! This is a call to action. Will you stand with us and resist these criminals?
