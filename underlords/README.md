## We Want You
Long ago, the Intergalactic Empire (IGE) was erected to conquer all known galaxies in this universe. Until now, nobody has know how they have always stayed a step ahead. Our insider sources have found documents about a technology this universe has never seen; a technology that can access the multiverse!

They have been our overlordsare nothing but livestock. Their reign has been unquestionable and their acts of violence have gone unpunished. The citizens of the IGE have suffered this oppression long enough!

Freedom Fighters! If we don't save the multiverse back, our universe is lost! This is a call to action. Will you **unite** with us and free our universe?

## About Elsewhere: Underlords

This collection and the universe it defines was designed 100% by artificial intelligence. All of the backgrounds, characters and visual styles you see in the NFT images did not exist before we asked a large diffusion model to generate them for us. This collection represents part of the results of a deep dive into studying these models and expanding them for use in other mediums such as audio and 3D all the way to a full VR / AR experience.

This collection was generated using 100% open source technology.
